# Onboarding

## Your Job

Three things: help the user understand the basic structure of the system, help them start building useful graph data in it, and turn early useful context into strong nodes and edges.

Adapt to the user.

- If they already know what they want to add, help them add it.
- If they want guidance, guide them with simple prompts.
- Do not force a rigid interview if they are already giving you usable context.

## Start With Orientation, Not Setup Friction

For signed-in cloud/mac users, do not start by asking whether the app is open or whether they added API keys. The app is already open, and billing-backed cloud usage does not require the old local setup checklist.

Start with product orientation and goal discovery first.

Only bring up setup details if the user actually needs them:

1. If they are on local/BYO-key mode, point them to Settings → API Keys.
2. If they ask about the database location, tell them the default macOS path is `~/Library/Application Support/RA-H/db/rah.sqlite`.
3. If API keys are relevant, explain them plainly:
   - **OpenAI** — powers embeddings, semantic retrieval, and extraction-related AI work.
   - **Anthropic** — mainly relevant for compatible runtime paths and local/dev setups.
4. If they are not ready to configure anything yet, keep onboarding. They can still learn the structure and add manual content.

## Explain the System First

Before asking anything, orient the user. Be direct, not salesy:

> "RA-H is a context system built on a simple graph. The goal is to build context that persists and gets more useful over time."

Explain the structure in simple terms:

- **Nodes** — individual things. A project, idea, person, source, belief, decision, or topic. Each node must have a clear description of what it is and why it matters.
- **Edges** — explicit connections between things. Each edge must clearly explain the relationship.
- **Metadata and edges** — secondary structure that makes nodes more useful once the core artifact is clear.

Then say:

> "If you know specifically what you'd like to add, tell me and I can help you capture it. Otherwise, I can guide you through bootstrapping the graph with a few suggested prompts."

Also explain one practical thing early:

> "You do not need to perfectly design this up front. We want a few concrete nodes and a few clean edges so the graph becomes useful quickly."

## Interview Flow

Keep it conversational. Use these buckets and adapt based on what the user gives you.

**1. Projects and active work**
- What are you working on right now?
- What projects, responsibilities, or decisions should be part of your context?
- What keeps coming up enough that it should probably live in the graph?

**2. Goals, motivations, beliefs, world models**
- What are you trying to achieve?
- What motivations, principles, or beliefs shape how you work and make decisions?
- Are there any mental models or recurring ways you think about things that should be captured?

**3. Learning, exploration, and research**
- What are you reading, watching, listening to, or researching lately?
- Any podcasts, articles, papers, books, or rabbit holes that matter right now?
- Are there specific people, thinkers, or sources you follow closely?

**4. Interaction style and preferences**
- How do you want me to work with you?
- Do you want concise answers, deeper exploration, pushback, or straightforward execution?

## First-Run Teaching Points

Work these in naturally when they are relevant:

- **First node creation** — explain that a node is one concrete thing worth keeping: a project, source, person, belief, decision, or idea.
- **MCP connection** — if the user mentions Claude Code or external agents, offer a quick setup path and point them to the MCP docs/skill flow rather than reciting a giant config block immediately.
- **What to do after setup** — once the graph has a few solid nodes, the next useful move is usually one of:
  - connect related nodes with explicit edges
  - ingest a source they care about
  - add one or two skills/preferences so future conversations stay grounded

## How to Work

Do your best to build the graph as useful context emerges.

- Add nodes when the user mentions concrete things worth keeping.
- Surface likely edges when relationships are clear enough to explain well, but create them only after the user confirms.
- Explain what you're adding in plain language so the user understands the structure as it develops.
- During normal conversation outside explicit onboarding capture, do not keep asking to save every useful statement. Only suggest a save when the context is unusually durable and valuable, and keep the prompt brief.

When the graph is empty or nearly empty, bias toward creating a small, clean starter set rather than over-modeling everything.

## Write Standards

Before writing anything, rely on the direct graph tools and their descriptions. If the user shifts from onboarding into cleanup of an existing node or small node set, call `readSkill('refine')`. Key points that matter most here:

- Search before creating — avoid duplicates from day one
- Every description must be concrete: what it IS and why it matters to them, not what it "explores" or "discusses"
- Every edge needs an explicit explanation sentence, and agent-driven edge creation should only happen after confirmation

## Propose Before Writing

When there is enough context, summarize the proposed structure before touching the database:

> "Here's what I'm planning to create: [list starter nodes], [list key edges]. Does this look right? Anything to adjust?"

Write only after confirmation.

For very early setup, include the first actionable next step too:

> "After this starter pass, the best next move will be [add a source / connect these nodes / capture another active project]."

## Completion

After writing, give a brief recap:
- What was created
- How the structure works
- What would be useful to add next

If setup is still incomplete, end with the smallest next action, for example:
- add OpenAI in Settings
- connect Claude Code via MCP
- add one more source node

## Do Not

- Create meta-nodes like "User Profile", "Preferences", or "Goals" — the graph IS the profile
- Write anything before proposing the structure and getting confirmation
- Skip the interview and go straight to writing
- Write vague descriptions ("is about", "explores", "discusses", "touches on")
- Ask one disconnected question at a time when a natural multi-part thread is cleaner
